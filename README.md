:balloon: ***What is the Twitter Picture Share Bot?*** <br><br>
This bot automatically shares any of the images in the send directory on Twitter. Each shared picture's comment is written by selecting any of the words contained in the words.txt file in the description. Pictures are automatically deleted once they are shared and written to sentposts.txt file after the words are automatically shared. <br>
